# Baseball Decision Tree Model

This is a project that I am using to practice more machine learning models

The model I used here is a decision tree. I wanted to implement a decision tree and try out
some methods that could hopefully make it more accurate. The accuracy is still bad but, I learned
a lot and had the chance to do some pretty good EDA.

### Takeaway

The project was a good learning experience even though the model was not good.
